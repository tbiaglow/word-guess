## Overview

<!-- TODO: add a description of your assignment, theme, approach, and solution here -->
This is a word guess game based on the Youtube show, Cobra Kai. The user must guess the name of the character. The CSS color scheme matches that of the show. All functions work as intended. However, my game makes use of capital letters and spaces. I used getElementById in the logic.js file to manipulate HTML objects.
